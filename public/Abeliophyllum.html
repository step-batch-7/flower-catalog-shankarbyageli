            <p>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the
              olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea, where
              it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in
              having white, not yellow, flowers. </p>

            <p> It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3
              to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new
              leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a
              round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter. </p>

            <p> It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.</p>
